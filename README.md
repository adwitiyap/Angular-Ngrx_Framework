# Adwitiya-Framework

This project presents a basic framework for building Angular (7) based app using store based architecture (NGRX). It already has a sample "weather" module, following which new store based modules can be constrcuted.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
